    // What Are Packages in Java?
    // A set of classes and interfaces grouped together are known as Packages in JAVA. The name
    // itself defines that pack (group) of related types such as classes, sub-packages,
    // and interfaces that provide name-space management. Every class is a part of a
    // certain package. When you need to use an existing class, you need to add the package within
    // the Java program.

    // there are 2 types of packages - built-in and user-defined packages

    // to use or access the built-in packages in the program use the import keyword
    // to create a user-defined package

    // To create a package, you should be aware of the Java file system directory. This is similar
    // to the files and folders organized on your computer. You need the help of the keyword
    // “package” to create your own package. The declaration of the package should be the first
    // statement before any import statements in the Java class.

    // Before creating your own package, you need to keep in mind that all the classes should be
    // public so that you can access them outside the package.

    // Let us consider our example of a User-defined package - University.Department.Staff.
    // package university
    // package university.department
